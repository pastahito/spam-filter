Future Directions of Database Research - Changes in the VLDB
Conference PC Structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
----------
At last year's VLDB Endowment meeting (New York, 1998), concerns were
expressed that the area of database research may  lose the pivotal
role it now plays among information system technologies. It was agreed
that the Endowment should maintain a watch on trends and future
directions in the general area of information management to ensure
that database research in general, and the VLDB conferences and
journal in particular remain current and relevant. It was decided to
set up a small "future directions" working group which maintains an
ongoing dialogue with key researchers in the DB community and reports
back to the Endowment Board. Working group members were Rakesh
Agrawal, Michael Brodie, Michael Carey, Umesh Dayal, Jim Gray, Yannis
Ioannidis, John Mylopoulos, Hans Schek, Kyu-Young Whang and Jennifer
Widom.



Situation
---------
The main observation of the working group was the following: While
database technology has achieved a high standard in research and
development, its future role in a globally distributed information
network is less central. Considering the central role of databases in
the past in providing a platform for application development, the
members strongly felt that actions must be taken. Of course, it is
true that databases still do a great job as storage managers for many
applications. However, it was felt that the distance to applications
and application development has grown substantially during the past
decade. Among others, the following examples of application
development and application areas were discussed as evidence for the
need to act:

 * Managing components, application services
 * Distributed client/middleware/server computing
 * Application frameworks, ERPs
 * XML, e-commerce

To bring such topics into the fold of database conferences, the
working group proposed to distinguish between the two main research
directions:

 (1) core database technology
 (2) infrastructure for information system development

While (1) is well established and will be further developed worldwide
by the international DB research and development community, the
infrastructure direction (2) is under-developed and under-represented
at conferences.

In all examples given above, the database role of providing a storage
manager, i.e. core DB technology remains central. However, client
application development takes place on other platforms provided by
middleware technologies. Or client applications are obtained by
customizing pre-fabricated ERP systems. The focus of our community
should turn to the investigation of how core technology can become
more widespread and usable, by concentrating on the description of new
application areas, on the methods and tools for data analysis, design
and integration, on the technologies for data deployment in modern
architectures (middleware, wireless technology, the WEB), and in
general on all the problems and challenges which are due to the need
of using very large databases in new contexts.



Action
-------
In order to evolve into these directions the Endowment has decided
during this year's Board meeting (Edinburgh, 2003) to take actions
with regard to the selection of tutorials, panels and invited speakers
for future VLDB conferences.  Most important for the community is the
following change in the VLDB Conference PC structure: While in the
past there were two PCs for the scientific and industrial tracks tof
the program, in future VLDB conferences a new track called "IS
infrastructure and applications" will be added. Therefore in future
Calls-for-Papers for VLDB conferences, three subcommittees will be
distinguished, responsible respectively for papers on:

 * Core DB technology
 * IS infrastructure and applications
 * Industrial applications and experience

The new strategy will be fully implemented in the year 2002 but
efforts are undertaken to realize it earlier in the upcoming VLDB
conferences in Cairo and Rome.  For more information on the plans of
the VLDB2000 organizing committee, please refer to the conference URL,

Please tell me more about why you are interested and what your
relevant background is, including internships and career plans.
The course is graduate-level so I am only accepting very well-qualified
students.

Actually, my research area is applied AI.  I taught the graduate course
on this topic at Harvard last year, and I consult now on automated text
classification and related technologies for Hewlett Packard Labs and
other technology companies.  I would be happy to help Affinia
deploy relevant algorithms as a consulting assignment.

You did not directly answer my point about why do business with
shop owners if they are unscrupulous (your word).
I also consult on Internet business strategies.  It's getting
transparent and old to inflate customer numbers etc.

Dissertation Abstract:
**********************
This dissertation addresses issues in event and activity based information
retrieval in visual information management (VIM) systems. The primary focus
 is on the
temporal composition of activities from events, which are a type of atomic
semantic units
in visual and other sensory information. It is shown that associating a
 bounded interval
of uncertainty,D, with event occurrences forces the concurrency between
 events to be
intransitive. Such intransitive concurrency between events are not modeled by
sequential
or weak order temporal compositions. Semiorders, which form a proper subclass
of partial
orders, model such compositions under the assumption of a fixed common bound
for D over a
set of given events. Semiorder based model provides a natural evolution of
sequential and
weak order composition rules for activity composition from events.

The issues of justification of underlying assumptions, expressive power,
and computational complexity
for morphism class of operations on semiorders are addressed in this thesis.
The
canonical tree-like structure of semiorders is described and efficient
algorithms and
heuristics for morphism operations are presented. Many issues related to the
usage of the
model in the context of activity retrieval in a multi-sensory monitoring
environment,
which produces a large amount of sensor data, are described. The architecture
that
implements the semiorder model includes a transducer subsystem for detection
 of atomic
events and a semiorder database that stores events and their temporal
 semiorder order.
This database provides facilities for flexible definition and retrieval of
composed
activities. The semiorder data model, an algebraic query language, and a
semiorder
pattern definition language are main components of the semiorder database.
 The semiorder
data model extends the relational model with semiorder ordering of tuples.
 The query
language provides for many classes of operations including classes of ordered
aggregation
and morphism operations. Morphism operations work with semiorder patterns as
well.
Details of the query and the pattern definition languages are provided and
related issues
are discussed in this thesis. Finally, the implementation of architectural
components is
briefly discussed, and results of a few illustrative queries from the domain
 of

multi-sensory monitoring environments are provided.

   ====================

      Creation of a research position for the mu-COMM+ project
     ==========================================================



The PLUME group at LIP (ENS-Lyon) and the company NTSys offer jointly
a post-doc position with a qualification in the following domain :

- formal methods,

- micro-computer operating  systems,

- JAVA.



A more precise profile on the following field is wished :

- formal methods applied to security protocols,

- LINUX,

- JAVA card and its byte-code.


In addition the applicant should  have some of the following qualities:

- autonomy and initiative,
- curiosity et innovation spirit,
- rigor toward security, quality of development and documentation,
- ability for team working.



Working environment
- -------------------

The post-doc will be part of the mu-COMM+ action of the PLUME group of
the computer research Laboratory (LIP) of the Lyon Ecole normale
superieure.

mu-COMM+ is an action sponsored by the French program OPPIDUM of the
French Ministry of Economy, Finances and Industry.

PLUME group competences are in the domain of formal methods applied to
security protocols, as in the LINUX system (version DEBIAN) and in
JAVA cards.  As a member of the PLUME research group the post-doc will
be able, if he or she wishes, to participate to the group and
laboratory activities (seminars, working groups, training, meetings
with researchers of other groups, sport and cultural activities of
ENS, etc.)  Moreover, he will be able to use his or her spared time
for personal research connected with the project.  The working
language will be French or English.


mu-COMM+ action is a collaboration between PLUME and the company
NTSys, a start-up founded in October 1998 by two computer engineers of
the Lyon urban community specialized in NICT (New Information and
Communication Technologies) and high performances distributed
applications.  NTSys is positioned as a software editor and an
integrator of electronic commerce solutions.


Aims
- -----

The aims of the mu-COMM+ action are to improve high performance
micro-payment techniques on Internet.  The post-doc will work on

    - the analysis and formalization of security protocols,
    - the identification of cryptography algorithms adapted to mu-COMM+,
    - the preparation of a certification by the "Common Criteria for
security",
    - the integration of  the mu-COMM+ software into LINUX,
    - programming of smart cards for authentification and
micro-payment applications.

Random noise can be helpful because it allows one to distinguish
the direction of causation, i.e. to distinguish y = f(x) + noise
from x = finverse(y) + noise

xor can be represented by a four-line truth table just like all
the sixteen different binary Boolean operations.  I don't see any
basis for calling some of the sixteen simpler than others.  I do
think that the monotonic operations are more common in nature,
however.

Hello!  Scott Baden tells me you are doing excellent work in his graduate
 course this quarter, so I would like to invite you to register for 250A in
 the winter quarter.  This is an AI course that will also have interesting
 projects involving programming and paper-writing.

250A will be very good preparation for research even if you do not plan to
work in AI later, and AI techniques can be useful across computer science

                        COURSE ANNOUNCEMENT

                            Winter 2000

                 CSE 250A: Artificial Intelligence

                        Section id: 361252

                            Instructor:
                 Charles Elkan, Associate Professor

                             Lectures:
        Tuesdays and Thursdays 11:10am to 12:30pm in APM 6301

                  First meeting Tuesday January 11.



CSE 250A is a graduate course devoted to the basic concepts and
algorithms of modern artificial intelligence research.  250A is part
of a two-quarter sequence with 250B, which will be offered in Spring
2000.  250A will mainly cover reasoning methods, while 250B will focus
on learning methods.  Both courses will cover theory and applications,
with a special focus on Internet applications.  Some guest lecturers
from universities and research labs are expected.

The course will be based on an excellent textbook and on recent
technical articles.  Other readings and references will also be used,
which will be distributed as the quarter progresses.  Lecture notes
will be published on the web.

The 250A/250B sequence may not be offered in 2000/2001, so interested
students should take 250A now.  CSE 250A is open to all PhD and MS
students in computer science and cognitive science.

Graduate students from other departments are welcome also, as are a
small number of CSE seniors with excellent records.  These prospective
participants should contact the instructor at elkan@cs.ucsd.edu.
For undergraduates, CSE 250A and 250B may count as replacements for
CSE 150 and 151 as required courses.

The course will have an open-book final examination, but no midterm.
Students will work in teams of two or three doing four projects, each
lasting two weeks.  Most projects will require implementing an AI
method.  All projects will involve doing computational experiments and
writing a careful team report of up to ten pages.

Some specific AI topics that will be covered in CSE 250A include:
- knowledge-based search algorithms
- algorithms for two-player games
- knowledge representation in first-order logic (FOL)
- resolution methods for reasoning in FOL
- axiomatizing causal knowledge for planning
- planning algorithms
- object-oriented knowledge representation
- languages for practical knowledge-based systems
- Bayesian networks
- fuzzy logic and fuzzy control

ALL ACADEMICS AND STAFF AT UCSD (including UCSD Healthcare)

SUBJECT:  Draft UCSD Graphic Guidelines and Policies

In an effort to establish a consistent graphic look for UCSD's core
publications and web sites, the UCSD Marketing Council has developed draft
print and web graphic guidelines. Also incorporated into the guidelines are
updated UC policies regarding official use of the Seal and a draft overview
statement about UCSD. The goal of this effort is to create a graphic
standard that, with consistent application, will convey a distinctive and
positive image, and distinguish UCSD by assuring that its positioning is
clearly communicated at every opportunity. Application of the guidelines to
departmental publications and web sites will be on a voluntary basis.

The Council invites UCSD faculty and staff to review and comment on the
draft guidelines, posted at http://www.ucsd.edu/marketing/guidelines.  A
copy of the Guidelines also is available for review at all UCSD libraries
If you have any questions regarding this effort, or would like the Council
to make a Guidelines presentation to your department or organization, please
contact the Guidelines Committee Chair, Meredyth Potter White, at
mailto:mpotterwhite@ucsd.edu or at X46444.

We request that you forward your comments by December 21. The Marketing
Council will review all responses from the campus community as the basis for
redrafting the guidelines.  The Council's goal is to have the guidelines
finalized in early 2000.

Thank you for your assistance with this project.

Hi Charles,

If someone turns up, do let me know.

 > Have you tried Mike Pazzani?  I think he has a fair # of students.

Yep.  He said no, though.

 > Recruiting outside the US and Canada is the general way I would go.

Agreed -- in fact, my current postdoc (just finishing up) is Chinese,
via Ireland.  More about him, when next we meet.

I know from past experience that it is relatively easy to get foreigners
 here, as it is kinda like a student visa.
(... unlike tenure track positions.)

I want to first see if there is anyone associated with anyone I know,
before beginning a general call.

That was my understanding.  But maybe his wife has possibilities at UCSD?
(I think she's in biology.)

This is news to me.

Last Minute INC seminar!

Due to the availability of Brad Tonkes (who is here this
week after NIPS), we are having him give a talk tomorrow on
the subject of his NIPS paper with Janet Wiles and Alan
Blair:

Title: Evolving Learnable Languages

Authors: Bradley Tonkes (speaker!), Alan Blair, Janet Wiles

Dept of Computer Science & Electrical Engineering
University of Queensland

TUESDAY, December 7, 2003
12:00 noon

Room 003
Cognitive Science Building
University of California, San Diego

Abstract:

Traditional theories of child language acquisition center around the
existence of a language acquisition device which is specifically tuned for
learning a particular class of languages.  More recent proposals suggest
that language acquisition is assisted by the evolution of languages
towards forms that are easily learnable.  In this paper, we evolve
combinatorial languages which can be learned by a simple recurrent
network quickly and from relatively few examples.  Additionally, we
evolve languages for generalization in different ``worlds'', and for
generalization from specific examples.  We find that languages can be
evolved to facilitate different forms of impressive generalization for a
minimally biased learner.  The results provide empirical support for the
theory that the language itself, as well as the language environment of
a learner, plays a substantial role in learning: that there is far more
to language acquisition than the language acquisition device.

Joseph, two thoughts come to my mind on this:

(1) The biggest change in your syllabus is the algebraic slant.
I have never covered regular expressions, Post systems, algebraic
semantics, term rewriting, unification, or combinators.  All these
are algebraic topics that I think are too remote from everyday
PLs for a first-year general graduate course.

(2) Since Scott will be teaching 230 for the first time next
quarter, and who will teach it in future years is uncertain, I
suggest deferring any official syllabus changes until the future
is clearer.

Charles,

If Steve is not too busy he should be able to show you how the move the
files over to the pc in that room.
Or perhaps he can show me and I can show you.

As far as the projector, I can show you how to start it up.

Prof. Savitch:

Yes, I am currently in your CSE 130 class, and am interested in finding
a professor to sponsor me for a CSE 197 for next quarter.  Since you
deal with PLs in CSE 130, I thought this project might interesty you.
Would you or a Professor you know be interested in sponsoring a couple
of students for the following project next quarter:

We want to translate a program written in Cold Fusion, a server side
scripting language, into an EJB application.  We have a few different
students that are potentially interested in working on this project,
with myself being one of them.  It would be with a company called Epiq
Technologies.  Their web site is http://www.epiqtech.com and a contact
name there is Scott (858-467-9961).

Thank you in advance for any help you may have.  You can contact me at
my on campus email at needhim@ucsd.edu or by voice at 858-623-9953.

Sincerely,
Reid Hankins

Hello Charles,

The department is making provisions for grad courses which are either core
courses or courses with at least 40 students enrolled.  The provision is
for 25% TA and the selected TA must be taken from outside the regular TA
pool.  Since 250A does not meet either category, I'm deferring your request
to Paul and Larry for their approval.

Paul and Larry, please advise.  Please note that grad course allocations
come from the temp FTE $ and Charles is asking for about $1,040.

Thanks,
Nieves

Hi Charles,

I am beginning my search for a top-notch postdoc, to work with me
on a variety of projects, ranging from datamining, to probabilistic reasoning
to learning belief nets... preferably some one understands theoretical ideas,
and is also a great developer... and who can interact with local industry,
etc etc etc.  (Ie, kinda like you...)

If you know of any student who qualifies, can you point him/her to
    http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~greiner/postdoc.html
and encourage him/her to apply!

Thanks!

I hope things are going well.

Cheers,
	Russ

You are probably aware of programs like Third Voice and Gooey. I think in
fact you mentioned Gooey to me.

It occurs to me that you might be able to conceive some sort of
autoresponder that could read and respond to messages being posted. Or,
alternatively one could create filters to block display of junk messages.
One devious application might serve a commercial purpose. I imagine a
company using a machine-generated voice leaving messages at a competitors
site and responding to visitors to the competitors site with comments aimed
at shifting the user to the company's own site or product.

Just a thought.

Don't forget to come hear Paul Kay today in Cog Sci 200.  He gave a very
interesting talk last night at the psych colloquium.  If you missed it,
here's your second chance.

TODAY (Friday), CSB 003, 2:20pm

Color Appearance and the Evolution of Color Terminology Systems
Recent data from the World Color Survey suggest that much of  the general
pattern according to which color naming systems develop in the history of
languages may be attributed to language-independent properties of color
appearance. There is also a strong possibility that not all languages have
a lexical system that fully partitions the color space.  Color appearance
also appears to help explain how such lexical systems develop full-fledged
color term systems.

Hi Professor,
  We discussed using python today in class, but I have one more question.
I know it will be some more work for the TAs, but it will also be more
work for me. (e.g. implementing linear regression in Java _and_ Python)
However, I think it is rather unfair and limiting to have to discuss both
awk and Python in my paper if I decide to use Python. That would require
twice the work on the paper and would cause the paper to be less
interesting, as its scope would be wider. This also brings to mind another
question; Would I also be responsible for awk-specific questions on the
final? Thank you, and let me know what you think,

Matt

Attention Professors currently teaching undergrad classes:


Thursday, or at the latest Friday, you will find an envelope of TA
evaluation forms in your boxes. These are really important not only
to maintain the quality of TAs, but to reward those that do a good
job.  Your TAs really appreciate the feedback from the students.

Those teaching MW classes:
    Administer and return evaluations to Julie this Monday

Those teaching TTH classes:
    Administer and return evaluations to Julie this Tuesday


We know that you are really busy, so thank you in advance for your time.

Charles,

Hi. I'm sorry it has taken so long for me to get back in touch; I had a
very satisfying trip to Penn, but I've been very focused on
re-connecting with my work at Cornell before the Thanksgiving holiday.
In fact, I don't feel I yet have the focus to make the most of a
conversation with you. Would next week be okay?  Perhaps you could give
me a call at 7pm EST (4pm PST) next Tuesday?  If that is at all
inconvenient, I will be happy to work within your schedule.

Thanks again; I hope my scheduling uncertainties aren't trying your
patience.

Folks - If you'd like to contribute to the SDSC's portion of the toy/food
drive, but you'd like someone else to do the shopping, you're in
luck!  Again this year, Santa "Kim Baldridge" Claus has agreed to do the
honors.  Last year, SDSC staff sent Santa off to the mall with over
$1200!  Let's top it this year!  Please stop by her office with your wallet
open wide!  You'll also see one of Santa's helpers at the (free) luncheon
today.  It's been a very good year, together we can help make it a nice one
for those less fortunate.

Cool.  In the mad rush to get it out to you, I even forgot the

would like to talk a bit this evening to hash some ideas for vacation.

will you be home?

No, I don't think it would be right to offer extra credit for this.
It would not be fair to other students: even if I gave everyone
the opportunity, some people have planned to use their time for
other work.  Also, the differences between awk and Perl at least
are too small.

Let me add to Yannis's note that I also know Bertram very well and I'm
sure
he would do a very good job. I just wrote a job letter on his behalf for
SDSC --  I can
also send it to you if you'd like.

I think Alvaro would have also done a good job, although Bertram is
probably more suited for
a graduate course.

Hi Charles,

I thought about your request for help with AI in the winter, and I don't
think I should do it.  I think the benefits, which are substantial, would
nevertheless slow me down on my thesis work too much.  I don't need the
money now that I have the ARCS fellowship, and I am already trying to do
too much and having trouble getting to my thesis project.  I would, however,
like to sit in on the class if you don't mind.

All staff will once again be attending an
appreciation holiday lunch.  This year the
event is scheduled for Thursday, December 16.
We will be leaving around noon and will not be
returning to work.  Please plan accordingly
and thank you so much for your past support of
this absence.  The staff have really enjoyed
our previous lunches-- we talk, laugh and just enjoy
one another's company... it is great fun.
