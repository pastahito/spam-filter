 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

Dear Sir/Madam

My name is Mr. Mr. Akron Tutu, and I work in the International operation
department in a Local Bank here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I
discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 26,000,000
(TwentySix Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered
that the account holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no
beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any
foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from
Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody will
come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money
with legal claims to the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation
in thistransaction.

I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this
money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred.
If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full
details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost
confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my
family would be jeopardized if it were breached. I want to assure you that
the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly.
Finally I will give you 25% for your corporation. I look forward to a
favorable response from you.through my private e-mail: alpha2@africamail.com

Best Regards,
Mr. Akron Tutu.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

Sir

                    PARTNERSHIP IN BUSINESS

After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward to you this
 proposal. We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum
 of US$40.5M (forty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) only into his
 account.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract awarded by us
 under the budget, allocated to my ministry and the bill was approved for
 payment by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed.
 Commissioned, the contractor has been paid his actual cost for the contract.
 We are now left with the balance of US$40.5M as the over-invoiced amount,
 which we have deliberately over estimated for our own use.

But under our protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to operate or
 own a foreign account. This is why I contacted you for assistance. We have
 agreed that you will be entitled for 30% of the total sum, 60% for us while
 10% for any expenses incurred while transacting the business and whatever
 left from the 10% will be shared equally. As you may rightly want to know I
 got your address from our Chambers of Commerce and Industry. I am a top
 official with the Ministry of Petroleum Resources (MPR). We the officials
 involved in the deal have put in many years of services to our ministries.
 We have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to
 most of us, this is a lifetime opportunity we cannot afford to miss. This
 transaction is very much free from all sorts of risks.

 To enable us get this fund paid into your account, we have to present an
 international business outfit and consequent upon your agreement, we will
 fax to you the information you will transcribe into your invoice and send
 back to us. As soon as the funds are remitted into your nominated account,
 three officials will visit you to arrange for our share. All these will only
 take us 10 working days to transfer this fund into your account right from
 the day we receive the requirements.

 NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be limited,
 because we are still in Government service. Let honesty and trust be our
 watchwords throughout this transaction. And your Prompt reply will be highly
 appreciated.

Best regards.

Sunny Udoman

Software Agents-Oriented Workflows
(Concepts - Methods - Tools)
at
The 2000 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IC-AI'2000)
June 26 - 29, 2000, Monte Carlo Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA
Due Date: March 6, 2000

The Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) defines a WF as the automation of
a business process, in whole or part, during which documents, information
or tasks are passed from one participant to another for action, according
to a set of procedural rules. Currently, organisations tend to use WFs in
order to streamline and coordinate their business processes.

Generally, WFs are designed and saved for later use. Therefore, these WFs
are pre-defined and static. In this context, one potential drawback of the
WFs results from their no-adaptability. Moreover, with the recent progress
of communication middlewares, for instance object request brokers, and
programming languages for distributed applications, for instance JAVA,
WFs need to be flexible and scalable. In order to cope with these
 requirements, a promising approach consists of viewing a WF as a dynamic
 collection of collaborative processes that need to be clustered together.
 Clustering processes and managing their performance could be assigned to
 intelligent components, namely Software Agents (SAs). SAs are attracting
 much attention for their autonomy, cooperative behavior, and lately
 mobility. Whenever needed, and taking into account the characteristics of
 the environment in which they evolve, SAs cluster processes and order them
 in order to constitute the required WFs. Such an approach offers a great
 flexibility since process combination could be directly based on the agent's
 states, rather than being pre-defined in advance.

Topics of interests include but are not limited to:
* Modeling, designing, and developing software agents-oriented workflows.
* Software agents for managing cross-organisational workflows.
* Software agents for adaptive workflows.
* Applications such as e-commerce, Internet, etc.

I. NEW ARTICLES:


Argamon-Engelson, S. and Dagan, I. (1999)
  "Committee-Based Sample Selection for Probabilistic Classifiers",
   Volume 11, pages 335-360.
   Available in PDF, PostScript and compressed PostScript.

   For quick access go to <http://www.jair.org/abstracts/argamon99a.html>

   Abstract: In many real-world learning tasks, it is expensive to
   acquire a sufficient number of labeled examples for training.  This
   paper investigates methods for reducing annotation cost by `sample
   selection'. In this approach, during training the learning program
   examines many unlabeled examples and selects for labeling only those
   that are most informative at each stage. This avoids redundantly
   labeling examples that contribute little new information.
     Our work follows on previous research on Query By Committee, extending
   the committee-based paradigm to the context of probabilistic
   classification.  We describe a family of empirical methods for
   committee-based sample selection in probabilistic classification
   models, which evaluate the informativeness of an example by measuring
   the degree of disagreement between several model variants.  These
   variants (the committee) are drawn randomly from a probability
   distribution conditioned by the training set labeled so far.
     The method was applied to the real-world natural language processing
   task of stochastic part-of-speech tagging.  We find that all variants
   of the method achieve a significant reduction in annotation cost,
   although their computational efficiency differs.  In particular, the
   simplest variant, a two member committee with no parameters to tune,
   gives excellent results.  We also show that sample selection yields a
   significant reduction in the size of the model used by the tagger.


Cristani, M. (1999)
  "The Complexity of Reasoning about Spatial Congruence",
   Volume 11, pages 361-390.
   Available in PDF, PostScript and compressed PostScript.
   An online appendix (Lisp code) is also a available.

   For quick access go to <http://www.jair.org/abstracts/cristani99a.html>

   Abstract: In the recent literature of Artificial Intelligence, an
   intensive research effort has been spent, for various algebras of
   qualitative relations used in the representation of temporal and
   spatial knowledge, on the problem of classifying the computational
   complexity of reasoning problems for subsets of algebras.  The main
   purpose of these researches is to describe a restricted set of maximal
   tractable subalgebras, ideally in an exhaustive fashion with respect
   to the hosting algebras.
     In this paper we introduce a novel algebra for reasoning about Spatial
   Congruence, show that the satisfiability problem in the spatial
   algebra MC-4 is NP-complete, and present a complete classification of
   tractability in the algebra, based on the individuation of three
   maximal tractable subclasses, one containing the basic relations.  The
   three algebras are formed by 14, 10 and 9 relations out of 16 which
   form the full algebra.

Fox, D., Burgard, W. and Thrun, S. (1999)
  "Markov Localization for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments",
   Volume 11, pages 391-427.
   Available in HTML, PDF, PostScript and compressed PostScript.
   An online appendix (Movies) is also a available.

   For quick access go to <http://www.jair.org/abstracts/fox99a.html>

   Abstract: Localization, that is the estimation of a robot's location
   from sensor data, is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics.  This
   papers presents a version of Markov localization which provides
   accurate position estimates and which is tailored towards dynamic
   environments. The key idea of Markov localization is to maintain a
   probability density over the space of all locations of a robot in its
   environment. Our approach represents this space metrically, using a
   fine-grained grid to approximate densities.  It is able to globally
   localize the robot from scratch and to recover from localization
   failures.  It is robust to approximate models of the environment (such
   as occupancy grid maps) and noisy sensors (such as ultrasound
   sensors).  Our approach also includes a filtering technique which
   allows a mobile robot to reliably estimate its position even in
   densely populated environments in which crowds of people block the
   robot's sensors for extended periods of time.  The method described
   here has been implemented and tested in several real-world
   applications of mobile robots, including the deployments of two mobile
   robots as interactive museum tour-guides.

UCSD
CAMPUS NOTICE
University of California, San Diego

              OFFICE OF THE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR RESEARCH

                            December 1, 2003


ACADEMIC SENATE MEMBERS
KEY ADMINISTRATORS/KEY SUPPORT STAFF

SUBJECT:  2001-02 State Budget Research Initiatives

The Office of the President has invited the campus to submit up to five
proposals for research initiatives for possible inclusion in the 2001-02
Regents' Budget request. The purpose is to obtain State funding in support
of research over and above the State support we will receive in connection
with enrollment growth. The funding for these initiatives is "permanent" so
it can have a serious long term effect on UCSD research efforts.

Three research initiatives were included in the 2000-01 Regents' Budget
request: Engineering and Computer Science ($5 million), Environmental
Science ($5 million), and California-Mexico Collaborative Research ($5
million). A significant fraction of the $15 million has been requested for
graduate student support. You may find the text of these three initiatives
on the web at http://budget.ucop.edu/budget/200001/6/research.html beginning
on page 85.

The research priorities submitted by San Diego last spring for the 2000-01
budget were environmental science and policy, human development, gene
therapy, immigration, nanotechnology, and remote sensing. These were
considered by the Office of the President in conjunction with requests by
the other campuses and resulted in the present request in the Regents'
Budget.

The Office of the President is soliciting ideas for research initiatives
that meet the following criteria:


* The research topic is recognized as high priority to the State of
California by its legislative and executive lawmakers. High priority may be
defined in terms of contributions to economic growth and job creation or in
terms of contributions to societal health and well-being.

* The research topic is long-term, multidisciplinary, and of high scientific
and scholarly interest to UC faculty.

* UC possesses and identifies the faculty expertise and intellectual
resources that are collectively the best in the world to address the topic.

* The topic is not being effectively addressed by others, and UC is uniquely
positioned to do so.


In addition, we believe the ideas that UCSD forwards to the Office of the
President should:

* Be a high priority for the campus.

* Potentially involve a large number of UCSD faculty and students and be of
interest to faculty and students at other UC campuses.


Faculty with ideas that meet the above criteria are encouraged to work with
other faculty, their department chairs, and deans in developing the ideas

A one to two page statement of the idea should be forwarded to your dean (or
deans if the proposal involves faculty from more than one division), with
copies to your department chair, Vice Chancellor for Research Richard
Attiyeh (0003), and the Committee on Research (0002) by Monday, January 31,
2000.



      Richard Attiyeh                         Henry Abarbanel
      Vice Chancellor for Research            Chair
      Dean of Graduate Studies                Committee on Research

Larry and Paul,

 my application has already named (our x-own) Alvaro as the CSE232A
substitute and Alvaro has submitted his CV and related info for teaching
CSE232A. He has also requested the textbooks for the course, etc.

So, as things stand now, Larry is right: The plan of record is that Alvaro
will teach CSE232A and Victor will teach CSE132A, as he is scheduled to do.

The idea of switching Victor and Alvaro (having Victor in CSE232A and
Alvaro in CSE132A)  hasn't really moved (yet), as Paul says.

My comments: Regarding the changes in Victor's teaching schedule, which
will make this proposal happen, I'm obviously not the right one to make
comments or negotiate :)
So, having conveniently removed myself from how this proposal will be
implemented (and taking the risk of getting on Paul's nerves;-) I'll just
say that if I could choose who will teach what, I would prefer Victor to
give CSE232A because in this way the DB lab will get access to the grad
students. (I'll give some guest lectures anyway, but this is just a
half-measure.)

Krishna, I also really enjoyed our conversation, and being introduced
to Ed.  I would be happy to talk again this coming week, and to meet
Ted Crooks.  I have to ask--is this the same Ted Crooks that some
people are/were trying to recall from the Grossmont School Board?
If so, I applaud his stand against harassment.

There may be some way in which I can be of service to your company in
a consulting role.  On reflection, I should decline your kind offer to
introduce me to the Candian firm.  I am close to fully committed with
my UCSD work and consulting for HP Labs currently.  Also my real
technical interests are in data mining, artificial intelligence, and
I should stick to this focus.

The days I am available for lunch this coming week are Tuesday,
Thursday, and Friday.

Charles

With no plans to teach them again, we should
delete CSE 252 and CSE 255 from the catalog.
Then those numbers could be recycled.

In fact, I'll ask Pat to submit paperwork
to do that unless I hear an objection...

Maki, thanks for finishing the grading.  I want to return these today
so let's start before class as Renata suggests, and finish after 6:50pm.
That's too bad about the mean, but we can't change it now.

I will look at the exams that don't get picked up today.

Maki, did you mean you have some extra comments for me about the
exam, or for the students?

Hi folks,

Due to Sid's schedule, we're changing the date of the next General
Staff Meeting to Wednesday, Dec 15. Note that morning is the UCSD
holiday breakfast (7:00 - 9:00 am), so we won't have the usual
continental breakfast prior to the meeting. Agenda to follow.

Steph

Dear Charles,

I am very happy that you could kindly accept the DS2000 PC invitation,
because you are a prominent researcher in this field.
Let me send the CFP when the PC members are finalized.

Best wishes,

Gary, could you possibly do my CSE 130 lecture on Wed. Dec. 1?
It's from 6:50pm to 8:10pm.  Janet has a workshop in Orlando
and I'd like to go with her...

FYI


We've been having trouble locating some of the overhead projectors.  They
should be stored in room 4132 when not in use.  Please return them to this
room when your done using them.  Plus we cannot do our "bulb checks" and
keep them operating properly if they are not where they should be.  We
realize how frustrating it can be when  trying to make a presentation and
the machine won't work.  Please email us at (overheads@cs) when you know a
particular machine is not working   Bulbs do wear out and we can only fix
what we know is not working.



Thank you for your assistance and patience,
